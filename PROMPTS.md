## üöÄ Maximum Data Extraction (Comprehensive Analysis)

### 10. Complete Document Extraction with LlamaParse
Extract ALL available data from a document using LlamaParse's full capabilities.

**Maximum Extraction Prompt:**
```
Xray ./document.pdf with provider llama-parse and custom instructions: "Extract ALL possible information from this document including: 1) Complete text content preserving exact formatting, whitespace, line breaks, and indentation. 2) All tables with complete data, headers, and cell values in structured format. 3) All images with detailed descriptions, captions, alt text, and positioning. 4) Complete document metadata including author, creation date, modification date, title, subject, keywords. 5) Full document structure with all sections, subsections, headings at every level. 6) All form fields and their values. 7) All hyperlinks and cross-references. 8) All footnotes, endnotes, and annotations. 9) All mathematical equations and formulas. 10) Page-by-page layout information including margins, columns, text blocks. 11) All font information, text styling, and formatting. 12) Any embedded files or attachments. 13) Complete table of contents if present. 14) All lists, both numbered and bulleted. 15) Any watermarks or background elements. Extract entities including all person names, organization names, dates, times, monetary amounts, percentages, locations, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, URLs, legal references, product names, and technical terms. Preserve the complete document hierarchy and relationships between all elements. Include comprehensive analysis of document purpose, key findings, and relationships between entities."
```
